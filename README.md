# djbookapp

**Author**: Dave and Jasper
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This is a book database. It's main function is to allow the user to view a collection of their books. Apart from viewing their books, they can add or remove books from their database, and update existing books.

## Getting Started
This web app is designed to be a cloud app. Navigate to djbookapp.github.io/client to reach the user portal.

## Architecture
This app makes use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, and several other npm libraries, such as pg, body-parser, and cors. It combines these all to create a full stack web app.

## Change Log
2018-01-22 20:00PST: Initial content added.

## Credits and Collaborations
Thanks to the writers of the wonderful libraries listed in the Architecture section. This app would be considerably more difficult without their hard work.
